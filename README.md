# HistogramForIZ
This is a new version of the Matlab program for treating the IZ data to do histograms. It's suitable to treat .blq files larger than 3 GB, and can help to exclude some unwanted data from the histogram.

The 1.0 version contains an error of reading only the approaching curves which is corrected in the 2.0 version. The data seletor program help to check the IZ curves that show a half-quantum-conductance step, you can visualize them and choose to save them or not.

Run first the two functions 'ReducedblqreaderV6.m' and 'saveEasy.m' even though they will not be executed.
